    <!-- The services that needs to be started earlier in the boot sequence and in particular order.
      Every item in this array contains a flatten component name of a service that needs to be
      started and a list of parameters after hashtag symbol. Here's the format:

      <item>com.bar.foo/.Service#bind={bind|start|startForeground},user={all|system|foreground},
      trigger={asap,userUnlocked}</item>

      bind: bind - start service with Context#bindService
            start - start service with Context#startService
            startForeground - start service with Context#startForegroundService
            If service was bound it will be restarted unless it is constantly crashing.
            The default value is 'start'
      user: all - the service will be bound/started for system and all foreground users
            system - the service will be started/bound only for system user (u0)
            foreground - the service will be bound/started only for foreground users
            The default value is 'all'
      trigger: indicates when the service needs to be started/bound
            asap - the service might be bound when user is not fully loaded, be careful with
                   this value, the service also needs to have directBootAware flag set to true
            userUnlocked - start service when user unlocked the device
            userPostUnlocked - start service later after user unlocked. This is used when the
                               service is not urgent and can wait to start.
            The default value is 'userUnlocked'

      If the service bound/started for foreground user it will be unbound/stopped when user
      is no longer foreground.
